    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Ubuntu Animal Rescue is dedicated to saving, rehabilitating, and rehoming abandoned animals. 
    We believe in the spirit of community and compassion, ensuring every animal has the chance for a loving home.</p>
      <p>
    Ubuntu Animal Rescue was founded in 2015 in Gauteng with a simple vision:
    to give abandoned and abused animals a second chance at life. What started
    as a small community initiative has grown into a recognized rescue
    organization with volunteers, adoption programs, and community outreach. </p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>

    To provide safe shelter, medical care, and loving homes for abandoned
    animals. We believe every animal deserves a chance to be valued and cared
    for.

    A future where every animal in our community is safe, loved, and part of a
    family.
